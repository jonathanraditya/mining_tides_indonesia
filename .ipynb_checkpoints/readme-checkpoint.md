# Mining Tides Indonesia

`codewriter: Rafael Atantya`

A tides scrapper (miner) to get a 15-day hourly tides data from Indonesia's Geospatial Agency (BIG) for a defined resolution.

## The background
Tides is a very important requirements for flood analysis, especially in the low-land/swamp area in the lower part of the basin, near the sea, where the flood usually not only caused by the high discharge flow from the upper-part of the basin, but also the sea water elevation that may cause backwater that may disturb the free-flow state.

### Why this project is important
The bigger picture is, I want to create an Indonesian flood model for a certain flood return period. In order for this project to happen, I need a tides data from across Indonesia. 

## Limitation
Although covers up all area of Indonesia, based on my short exploration, this is not an observed data, but a predicted tides data. Use with caution, and refers up to your own project risks and requirements. Consider taking up the measurements by yourself if your project need more certainty.

## Appendix
Indonesia's Geospatial Agency (BIG) is the only official agency that provides publicly available tides data with full coverage across Indonesia in 2020.

Only for research use. Please refer to BIG for more information about the legal and permitted use cases.
